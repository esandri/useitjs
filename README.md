useitjs
=======

useitjs is a rapid application development based on angularjs nodejs unodestore

The aim of the project is a platform for create applications without the annoying tasks:

database schema
domain object
data access object
serialization and deserialization
etc etc ...
Really we are always writing the same things. Ok sometime this is necessary, but often ours requirements are very simple in term of application logic. Often the main requirements are to store data an presents its in a fancy way.
